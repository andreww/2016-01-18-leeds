<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.
</p>
<p align="center">

  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->

<p>
  The workshop is funded by <a href="//www.nerc.ac.uk/">NERC</a> as part of the 
  <a href="//www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/available/postgrad/advanced/atsc/">
  Advanced Training Short Courses</a> programme.
  Priority will thus be given to 
  NERC-funded PhD students and early career researchers from the environmental 
  sciences who should contact <a href="mailto:J.E.Mound@leeds.ac.uk">Jon Mound</a>
  for booking information. Some funding to cover travel and accommodation costs of 
  these participants is avalable. Any unallocated spaces will be made generally avalable 
  in early December.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at postgraduate students and other scientists who are familiar 
  with basic programming concepts (like loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions) but 
  need help to translate this knowledge into practical tools to help them work more productively.
  Priority will be given to NERC-funded PhD students and early career researchers from the environmental
  sciences.

     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>

<div id="shell"> <!-- Start of 'shell' section. -->
  <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Download the Git for Windows
	<a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">installer</a>. Run the
        installer. <strong>Important: on the 6th page of the installation wizard (the
        page titled `Configuring the terminal emulator...`) select `Use Windows'
        default console window`. If you forgot to do this programs that you need
        for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the
        installer and select the appropriate option.</strong> This will provide you
        with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.

  <h3>Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
        install (described above).

      <h4 id="git-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

        If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
        install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
        <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all <a
      href='http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility'>supported</a>
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).

  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h2>Before the workshop</h2>

<p>
There are a three extra tasks to undertake before the workshop in 
order to help make sure things run smoothly. Please try to do the
following.
</p>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">

<h3>1. Grab free accounts</h3>

<p>
If you haven't already, please register for free accounts to 
<ul>
<li>Make use of Github. Register <a href='https://github.com/'>here</a> and don't forget your password. We will use this service as part of the lesson on version control.</li>
<li>Use the Met Office datapoint API. Register for an account 
<a href='http://register.metoffice.gov.uk/register/datapoint'>here</a>. We may use this as a data source for some of the exercises.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>2. Take a look at Bash, and maybe look at Python</h3>
<p>
We would like to get started with bash quickly at the start of
the workshop. It would be useful if everybody could take a look 
at the first three shell lessons, found 
<a href='http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/00-intro.html'>here</a>,
<a href='http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/01-filedir.html'>here</a>,
and <a href='http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-create.html'>here</a>,
to either remind yourself of how a shell works, or to have a first
look if this is new to you.
</p>
<p>
If you are new to Python, or you fear that your Python is rusty, it 
may be worth taking a look at an online introduction. Christopher 
Woods has a nice short introduction 
<a href='http://chryswoods.com/beginning_python'>here</a>. 
If you can follow this as 
far as "conditions", you are good to go. We will be reviewing this 
material anyway, so don't worry if you get stuck.
</p>

<!-- Make the next bit accessable before the start of day 1 -->

  <h2>During and after the workshop</h2>
  <p> We have gathered together the various links you will need and useful 
      information below. These will remain accessable after the workshop and 
      we will add to this list as the workshop progresses. Please read and 
      abide by the <a href='http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html'
      >code of conduct</a>.</p>

  <p> We will make use of
      <a href="{{page.etherpad}}">this etherpad</a>
      during the workshop. Please use this to keep collaborative notes and ask 
      (and answer) each others questions. Feel free to tweet from the workshop using 
      <a href='https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23SWCLeeds'>#SWCLeeds</a>.</p>

  <h3>Workshop material</h3>
   <p>Much of the material we will be using during the workshop can be found online
      and you will need copies of this on your laptop. In order to download the material 
      for the first session (and to
      check you have a working system with internet access) please start a new
      shell and type the following commands:
<pre class="in">
<code>cd 
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/andreww/2015-08-26-leeds-bash.git
cd 2015-08-26-leeds-bash</code></pre>
      (typing return after each line). You should see something like
      "repository successfully cloned". Let us know if this does not work 
      for you.
   </p>

   <p>Archived material for <a href='2015-08-26-leeds-bash.zip'>bash</a>, 
      <a href='sc-python-1.zip'>python</a>
      and <a href='2015-08-26-leeds-defensive.zip'
      >defensive programming</a> can be downloaded as
      zip files. Aaron&apos;s git material can be found at <a
      href='http://aaren.me/2015-08-26-git/'>http://aaren.me/2015-08-26-git/</a>
   </p>

  <h3>Stuck somewhere new?</h3>
   <p>
    If you find yourself in a shell that you don't recognise, or in an editor 
    that you can't get out of then see 
    <a href="http://hpcarcher.github.io/2015-04-16-imperial/novice/ref/05-prompts-exits.html">recognising prompts and how to exit</a>.
